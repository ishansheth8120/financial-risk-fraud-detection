# Financial Risk Assessment and Fraud Detection Platform  

## Project Overview  
The Financial Risk Assessment and Fraud Detection Platform identifies risks and flags suspicious financial transactions using machine learning. It features data ingestion, risk scoring, anomaly detection, a web-based dashboard, real-time alerts, and cloud deployment, emphasizing security, scalability, and practical insights into financial risk management.

## Features  
- **Data Ingestion**: Upload and preprocess transaction data (CSV, Excel).  
- **Risk Scoring**: Evaluate transaction risks using machine learning models.  
- **Fraud Detection**: Identify anomalies and flag suspicious activities.  
- **Dashboard**: Visualize transactions, risk scores, and fraud flags through a web-based interface.  
- **Real-Time Alerts**: Notify users of flagged fraudulent transactions.  
- **Cloud Deployment**: Host the platform for accessibility and scalability.  
- **Security**: Implement basic authentication, HTTPS, and secure data transmission.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Frameworks**: Flask  
- **Libraries**: pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, SQLAlchemy  
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (optional: React.js)  
- **Visualization**: Plotly, Chart.js  
- **Cloud Platforms**: AWS, Google Cloud, or Heroku  

## Project Goals  
1. Build a foundational understanding of risk assessment and fraud detection.  
2. Develop practical skills in Python, machine learning, and web development.  
3. Deploy a fully functional platform to the cloud.  
4. Ensure security and scalability of the application.
